                <b>Welcome to the Microsoft Cloud #CompanyName#!</b><br>
                This #EventType# is for anyone interested in Microsoft 365 and Azure; we focus on all three clouds of the Microsoft platform: Business Applications, Modern Workplace and Azure.<br><br>
                
                The #EventType# is a free to attend event, hosted at the Ageas Bowl, Southampton on the first Tuesday of each month, kicking off at #StartTime#.<br><br>
                
                Unlike other #EventType#s (who typically focus on a single area); the #CompanyName# rotates its focus quarterly, covering - Biz Apps, Azure and Modern Workplace.<br><br>
                
                We typically have 2-3 sessions per meetup, with each session lasting between 20-40 minutes. Anyone is welcome to submit a session - all sessions will be scheduled (no approval or review process).<br><br>
                
                The #CompanyName# is proudly supported by Microsoft, Mexa Recruitment CPS. These sponsors help support the cost of venue hire and providing food and drink for all attendees ( #Refreshments#! ). There's usually some SWAG being handed out too!<br><br>
                
                Registration, event dates, and the agenda are published via our Meetup page. Alternatively, if you follow our LinkedIn or Twitter channels – you’ll see regular updates and announcements.<br><br>
                
                The group is hosted by the community, for the community.")
